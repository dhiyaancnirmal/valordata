## Current Placeholder

A simple SVG with "World" text is currently being used. It will work, but replacing it with the official logo will look much better!

## File Location

The logo should be at:
```
/Users/dhiyaan/code/valor2/valor/world-logo.svg
```

## Important

Make sure to follow World's brand guidelines:
- Use the official logo without modifications
- Maintain proper spacing
- Use black version on white background (as we are)
